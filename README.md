## Overview

The goal of this UC Berkeley MIDS Capstone is to build tech to help educated social media users about their exposure to and engagement with disinformation online.

Our goal is to reduce the spread of disinformation, and to accomplish this, we score users based on a series of dimensions calculated from their Twitter content. We then provide the user their top three tweets that contributed to their disinformation score. What's unique about our approach is that we segment Twitter users at an individual-level and customize the education information users receive on our platform.

The MVP is built using US politician Twitter data, but we hope to connect with privacy experts and investors to take our product to the next level so we can provide these features to Twitter users worldwide.
