                              Politician data contains approximately 500,000 tweets published between the 2022-2023 from 485 US congress members. To collect the latest 100 tweets per politician, we created pipelines to extract this data using the Twitter API, and for historical tweet data, we used our partner <strong><a href="https://www.torch1.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Torch’s platform</a></strong> to extract tweets in CSV files. The politicians’ metadata including their Twitter handle, party affiliation, political office, and state/district was pulled from secondary sources including <strong><a href="https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/members-official-twitter-handles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Press Gallery House</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://ucsd.libguides.com/congress_twitter/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UC San Diego</a></strong>.
                              Below is an example of a tweet that was obtained from the data source:
                              <br><br><img src="img/sample-tweet-small.png" alt="Tweet Example" width="500" height="154">
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              Text from tweets was cleaned up in order to run inside of the pre-trained models. Non-standard symbols were trimmed and contents such as links and common stopwords were removed from the corpus. Lastly, different variations of the same word were lemmatized so that they were evaluated the same way in the models.
                              Ultimately, the prepped data of the tweet example above would look like:
                              <br><br><strong>[“interesting”, “time”, “biden”, “announce”, “ending”,  “covid”, “emergency”]</strong>
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              Some initial observations were drawn upon reviewing the data. The average politician in our dataset produced 630 tweets per year, of which the most popular themes were healthcare, gun violence, energy, inflation, and infrastructure. In terms of who was referenced within the tweets, the most common subjects were the President of the US, the members from the partisan left and right wing, and media outlets like Fox News.
                          </p>
                        </div>

                              We have two parts to our modeling: 1) scoring text with existing research models; 2) aggregating scored text to evaluate each Twitter user. Using existing research on detecting truthfulness and sentiment with large language models, we incorporated them into our pipeline to score Twitter tweet content. We used a total of 8 pre-built models including: 3 models for detecting the truthfulness of tweets and 5 sentiment models for detecting hate, irony, offensive, joy, and anger. Check out the <strong><a href="#models">"Our Models"</a></strong> section to learn more about each individual model.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              Each model was trained on various datasets. For example, the 5 sentiment models were trained using the following datasets:
                              <li>The <strong>irony detection task</strong> determines whether a tweet includes ironic content or not and the model used the Subtask A dataset of the SemEval2018 Irony Detection challenge (Van Hee et al., 2018).</li>
                              <li>The <strong>hate speech detection task</strong> determines whether a tweet is hateful or not against any of two target communities: immigrants and women. The dataset of choice stems from the SemEval2019 Hateval challenge (Basile et al., 2019).</li>
                              <li>The <strong>offensive language detection task</strong> identifies whether some form of offensive language is present in a tweet. The model used the SemEval2019 OffensEval dataset (Zampieri et al., 2019).</li>
                              <li>This <strong>emotion recognition task</strong> consists of recognizing the emotion evoked by a tweet. We specifically looked at joy and anger for the purposes of our project and used the dataset for the most participated task of SemEval2018, “Affects in Tweets” (Mohammad et al., 2018).</li>
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              To create a composite score for each user, all tweets are scored, scaled using a standard scaler, and added together. For example, starting with 9 different scores for each tweet, we scale them so that 0 is neutral, positive is good behavior, and negative is bad behavior. These 9 different scaled scores are summed together for a composite score of the tweet of the user.
                              Then, we calculate the average composite tweet score for each user for all their tweets to arrive at an aggregate score for each user. The final aggregate score for each user represents how susceptible a user is to spreading disinformation.
                          </p>

                              Given that many of our models assess sentiment, which is largely subjective, it was quite challenging to assess model performance objectively. Even for a matter such as truth, the difficulty lies in how to rate statements that merely constitute an opinion, or are roughly true but contain a small falsehood. Thus, aside from confirming the validity of models within an individual context by referencing the sources they came from, human evaluation was another approach taken to determine how agreeable the model outputs would be, on average, in comparison to a human observer.

                              In general, our chosen models had promising results in terms of sentiment and text analysis, and also served to demonstrate potential shortcomings and challenges to overcome in their next iterations. While they overall did well in detecting the negative sentiments of hate, irony, and offensiveness within tweets, truth detection was a much more difficult problem. When comparing human ratings to their equivalent model outputs, the model scores differed from their human counterparts by an average of 15% in the sentiment-based models, but a whopping 52% in the truth-based models.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              These numerical figures should be taken with a grain of salt, however. Even between human evaluators, there was a measured difference of 3% and 17%, respectively, between different human ratings.  Thus, part of this discrepancy can be explained as the objective difficulty in rating the truthiness of many short statements (evident in the person-person score differences), while another part could potentially be chalked up to the limited body of text that is present in tweets. It appears that certain models may rely on a larger corpus of text in order to detect idiosyncrasies and false statements.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              Interestingly, the truth sentiment graphs largely seemed to agree with one another, which suggests that they might be “thinking” the same way. Further steps to improve the model may constitute undertakings such as integrating the text or image within links as an input, using retweets, likes, and comments to add context to individual scores, and continuing the cluster analysis in model combination to determine if any interesting groups of users emerge.

                                Our product's data pipeline includes the following components:
                                <li><strong>Twitter API:</strong> The data pipeline retrieves tweets from the Twitter API. The pipeline can use different APIs provided by Twitter, such as the Twitter Streaming API or the Twitter Search API.  For this project the Twitter API used was the user lookup and tweet lookups search functionality.</li>
                                <li><strong>BigQuery:</strong> The data pipeline uses BigQuery as a cloud-based data warehouse to store and analyze large volumes of data. It integrates well with other Google Cloud Platform services, and in this case, it serves as a data storage and processing layer.</li>
                                <li><strong>Tweet Analyzers:</strong> This is a machine learning-based tool used in the data pipeline to analyze the sentiment of the tweets pulled from Twitter.</li>
                                <li><strong>User Segmentation:</strong> The final output of the data pipeline is user segmentation based on the sentiment scores calculated for each tweet. The data pipeline groups users into different segments based on their overall sentiment, such as positive, negative, or neutral.</li>
                            </p>

                                Here's how the data pipeline works:
                                <li>The data pipeline retrieves tweets from the Twitter API.</li>
                                <li>The data pipeline stores the tweets in BigQuery which serves as the data storage and processing layer.</li>
                                <li>Tweet Analyzers are used to analyze the sentiment of each tweet and provide a score from 0 to 1 on how each sentiment is scored.</li>
                                <li>Based on the sentiment scores, the data pipeline groups users into different segments.</li>
                                <li>The final output of the data pipeline is a set of user segments that can be used to gain insights into user behavior based on their disinformation score.</li>

                          <h4>How to Interpret the Radar Plot</h4>
                          <p>
                              The radar plot shows the performance of six models for a selected user. The scores represent the politician's rank, also called percentile, compared to other politicians across six domains of interest. The models initially scored politicians on a scale from 0 to 1 and ranked the results to obtain a value. The value indicates how the user performs compared to others. For example, a score of 93% in one category suggests that the user performs better than 93% of other users but worse than 7% (100 - 93 = 7) of users. A larger graph with a hexagonal shape indicates better performance compared to other users and suggests the user has an overall positive influence on the Twitter network.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              In summary, the radar plot provides a representation of a politician's relative performance across multiple domains of interest  and visualizes an overall pattern of behavior of a user on Twitter.
                          </p>
                          <h4>How to Interpret the Distribution Plot</h4>
                          <p>
                              The distribution plot displays the distribution of values obtained/calculated from the last 100 tweets for the selected politician. The x-axis indicates the tweet’s rank, also called percentile, for a selected model/score. The y-axis represents the count of tweets per percentile bucket. A high peak approaching the 90th percentile suggests that a significant number of the politician's tweets outperform those of other politicians in the selected domain of interest.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              In summary, the distribution plot provides a representation of a politician's tweet performance in a domain for a given model. It indicates whether their tweets perform better or worse than those of other users.

                              Our team’s intention for building this product is to educate social media users, but we must acknowledge that it has the potential to be used in ways that go against our mission and values. The models we use to score tweets on truthfulness and sentiment have limitations and possible biases as they are only as good as the data they were trained on. While we strive for accuracy, there are limitations to these methods, including variations in the interpretation of language and the subjective nature of determining what constitutes "fake news." Therefore, the scores should be taken as indicative rather than definitive.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              This project aims to (1) inform Twitter users about the content that politicians are sharing on the platform and (2) inform politicians on how they might be contributing to the spread of fake news. We strongly advise our viewers to review the <strong><a href="#product">"Results"</a></strong> section for how to critically interpret and evaluate the results of a given politician. When in doubt, please feel free to reach out to anyone on our team and we would be happy to help.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              It is essential to use these scores alongside other sources of information (such as <strong><a href="https://www.factcheck.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FactCheck.org</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://www.politifact.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Politifact</a></strong>) and critical thinking to make informed decisions.

                          <h4>Methodology Limitations</h4>
                          <p>
                              As with any data science project, there are limitations to the methodology we have used in scoring politicians based on their tweets.
                              <li>Fake news detection and sentiment analysis are not perfect, and errors can occur due to language nuances, emotions, and other factors that may be difficult to detect algorithmically.</li>
                              <li>Our scoring system relies solely on Twitter data, which may not provide a complete picture of a politician's record or views.</li>
                              <li>Our project may be subject to biases inherent in the data we used.</li>
                              <li>The project focuses on US politicians tweet content, which may not provide a complete picture of the politicians’ community and perspectives.</li>
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              While we have taken steps to ensure that our project adheres to ethical principles, we acknowledge that there may be unpredictable, unintended consequences or ethical implications that we need to consider further. We encourage users to interpret our results with these limitations in mind and to use our project as one of many sources of information when making decisions about politics and public discourse.

                          <h4>Model Limitations</h4>
                          <p>
                              Overall, our models present a promising start in terms of sentiment and text analysis, as well as highlight potential shortcomings and challenges to overcome in the next iterations of our models. While they overall perform strongly in detecting the negative sentiments of hate, irony, and offensiveness within tweets, there is much room for improvement when it comes to truth detection. When comparing human ratings to their equivalent model outputs, the model scores differed from their human counterparts by an average of 15% in the sentiment-based models, but a whopping 52% in the truth-based models.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              These numerical figures should be taken with a grain of salt, however. Even between human evaluators, there was a measured difference of 3% and 17%, respectively, between different human ratings.  Thus, part of this discrepancy can be explained as the objective difficulty in rating the truthiness of many short statements (evident in the person-person score differences), while another part could potentially be chalked up to the limited body of text that is present in tweets. It appears that certain models may rely on a larger corpus of text in order to detect idiosyncrasies and false statements. As an example, consider the following tweet:
                              <br><br><img src="img/sample-tweet2.png" alt="Tweet Example" width="500" height="201">
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              All three of the truth-based models were relatively skeptical about this tweet. Even though the human evaluators were able to search and verify the truthfulness of this claim, as well as view the accompanying photo of this politician with the cited individuals, the present-day models neither process images nor digest links, so they struggled with what was essentially “proper noun soup” - i.e. many organization/individual names without much context in between for semantic processing, since this tweet is essentially just a list of entities.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              Given the limitations of resources present during development, it is also likely that future iterations of our models would perform better than the present-date MVP presented here. Future iterations of the truth models would likely pull information present in linked text, as well as seek to understand more contextual factors in determining the truthfulness of more tweets. They may also employ more sophisticated flavors of models, such as large language models that revise and improve upon their performance given feedback (most notably, models akin to those used in OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot).
                          </p>

                            <p>The long short-term memory (LSTM) networks model works by first cleaning, tokenizing, and encoding the separated words of a sample of text, and then incorporating a variety of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are capable of learning long-term dependencies in order to grade each word. The words were embedded with values from Tensorflow’s wiki-words-250 embeddings, which uses a Word2Vec Skip-Gram architecture. <br><br>As an example, for the sentence “I am going on a trip in a boat”, the model will first split up each of the words into a sequenced array of words. It will ignore stopwords, in this case words like “I” and “am” which do not typically add a great deal of meaning. It will also “lemmatize” verb conjugations, in order to distill multiple forms of the same word into one unit -> “going” becomes “go”. The vector of words is then weighted using the previously mentioned embedding architecture. <br><br>After obtaining a vector with the words, a softmax regression classifier is then applied and the output is a probability vector for each tweet. Using an Adam optimizer, binary cross-entropy loss, and accuracy as our goal metric, we determined our truth scores for each tweet. <br><br>We chose this model because of its ease of implementation, and its transparency in process. The relative simplicity of the model lends itself towards being a good baseline to draw from. We used it as one of our models of identifying truth, alongside the Real and Dense Layer models. <br><br>This model was trained on the balanced University of Victoria’s ISOT Fake News Dataset, containing 12,600 real news articles from Reuters and over 12,600 fake news articles flagged by Politifact (a US-based fact-checking organization). The subject matter of the tweets is primarily political and world news.</p>

                            <p>The Dense Layer encoding model works in much the same way as the aforementioned LSTM model, but tries to improve on it. The term dense layer comes from the fact that the neurons that are processing inputs and sending outputs are listening to all neurons from the previous layer, i.e. the neurons are packed together more “densely”. <br><br>Text is cleaned, lemmatized, and split the same way as in the LSTM model. However, embeddings are provided instead using Gensim Doc2Vec Word Vectors. Our dense layers are also programmed with 20 and 5 neurons, respectively, and a ReLU activation function to aggregate outputs into one final rating score - and they utilize one layer of the previously-stated LSTM model earlier. <br><br>We chose this model to build upon and hopefully improve on some of the limitations of the LSTM models. Because the LSTM model is looking at each word independently, it can sometimes conflate multiple meanings behind the same word and treat sentences like a “string of words” vs. a semantic aggregation with context. Adding additional layers to encodings means that there are more opportunities for contextual meaning to translate into the final score output. We used this model as a second version of a truthfulness test. <br><br>The data for this model comes from the same source as the LSTM model, the University of Victoria’s ISOT Fake News Dataset.</p>

                            <p>The Cardiff models work by first cleaning, tokenizing, and encoding the separated words of a sample of text and then passes them through various transformers. They are trained on a large unlabeled corpus and then fine-tuned to the task for where an appropriate training set exists. <br><br>Training was done by starting with an original pre-trained Language Model (LM) and continued to train with Twitter data, keeping the original tokenizer and the same masked LM loss. For the tweet “Another illegal alien that shouldn’t be in America killed an innocent American couple! #BuildThatWall”, the models will make user mentions are anonymized and line breaks and website links are removed. After that it compares the word choices to predicting whether a tweet is hateful or not against any of two target communities: immigrants and women. The dataset of choice stems from the SemEval2019 Hateval challenge. <br><br>Based on the number of tokens that match and the probability it chooses the label for a given task.  There are 6 tasks of hate, irony, offensive, fake, joy, and anger. Each task has their own dataset that the tokens can stem from. <br><br>We chose this model because of its ease of implementation and its transparency in process. It was easy to download the model from HuggingFace and implement it readily. This model was trained on the 60 Million tweets and then evaluated against 40,000 tweets.</p>
